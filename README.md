## What it is

This is a version of the very well known "Concentration Game". Nanodegree students build this game as a project for honing JS, CSS and HTML skills together into a beautiful well-designed game.

Rules are simple, click on any card to flip it and show the symbol, click on another to check if both match. If cards match they stay revealed, if not they will flip back again. The goal is to match all cards with as few moves as possible.

Good Luck & Have fun! :sparkles:

### TO-DO

* Add CSS animations for clicking cards, matching and wrong. Perhaps for Shuffling too could be good.
* Implement leaderboard, store game using local storage.
* Add keyboard shortcuts for playing.
